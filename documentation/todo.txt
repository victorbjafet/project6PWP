documentation stuff:
top off documentation (dashboard.html and app.py are pretty much done, just do a final revision then maybe document everything else)
add to readme.md
improve the authorization explanation markdown

testing:

misc:
programming plan (why)
do all test cases and flowchart and description and maybe use copilot to help make things easier
